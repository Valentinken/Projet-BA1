"""This is a template for State Machine Modules

   A State Machine module is a python file that contains a  `loop` function.
   Similar to how an Arduino program operates, `loop` is called continuously:
   when the function terminates, it is called again.

   The `loop` function should continuously listens to messages generated by:
   - the path detector (concerning the path to follow),
   - the sign detector (concerning road signs detected, if any),
   - the remote command operator (concerning commands to start/stop driving,
     or do specific manoeuvers)
   - and the arduino controller of the physical car (concerning the current
     state; possible sensor readings, ...)

   and decide on how to drive the car correspondingly. See the description of
   the `loop` method below for more details.

    Like an arduino program, this function is called repeatedly: whenever
    it exits it is called again. Inside the function, call:
    - time.sleep(x) to sleep for x seconds (x can be fractional)
    - Event.poll() to get the next event (output of Path and/or Sign detector,
      status sent by the car, or remote command).
    - Car.send(x,y,u,v) to communicate two integers (x and y) and
      two floats(u,v) to the car. How the car interprets this message depends
      on how you implement the arduino nano. For the simulator, x, and y
      are ignored while u encodes the speed and v the relative angle to turn
      to.
